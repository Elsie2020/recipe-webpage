        <p> Ever wanted to make spam taste less salty? Or actually, <em>better?</em>This dish originated from Hawaii from a person name Barbara Funamura, a Japanese-American women! 
            This dish is basically grilled spam on top of a block of rice with nori wrapped around it! It's sweet, salty, sticky, and very cheap and easy to mmake!</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of <a href= "https://www.walmart.com/ip/SPAM-Classic-7-g-of-protein-12-oz/10290926?athbdg=L1200">spam</a></li>
            <li>Some <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Imperial-Light-Brown-Sugar-32-Oz/13908572">Brown sugar</a></li>
            <li>3 cups of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mahatma-Jasmine-Long-Grain-Rice-32oz/10848962">Jasmine Rice</a></li>
            <li>1 bag of <a href= "https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ocean-s-Halo-Sushi-Nori-Organic-Vegan-Gluten-free-Non-GMO-Perfect-Paper-for-Wraps-1-oz/618935385">Nori Wraps</a></li>
            <li>(optional)Either <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Huy-Fong-Sriracha-Hot-Chili-Sauce-9oz-Bottle/40890031">siracha or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/P-F-Chang-s-Home-Menu-Korean-Style-Gochujang-Hot-Sauce-10-oz/970597671?athbdg=L1200">Gochujang sauce (if you like it to be sweeter)</a></li></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps!</strong></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice the spam into about 8-10 pieces or depending on how thick you like it (keep the can!). I like mines a little crunchy so I cut them into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Grab a pan and heat it until it is <em><strong>hot</strong></em></li>
            <li>Coat the pan with some oil or butter</li>
            <li>After the pan is hot and has oil/butter on it, start cooking the spam pieces on medium heat</li>
            <li>Put however much siracha/gochujang sauce on it and spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in however much brown sugar you like (more sugar if you want more sweetness)</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes flip the spam to cook on the other side. The side that was cooking should look a bit brown and if it is not, keep cooking.</li>
            <li>Once you flip the spam, repeat steps 5 to 7</li>
            <li>After the spam is done, place them on a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Grab the Nori and cut them into 3-4 pieces, depending on if you like the Nori thick or not</li>
            <li>Grab the spam can and plastic wraps</li>
            <li>Put the plastic wrap in the spam can. Use a decent amount of plastic wrap. This is to form and wrap the musubi.</li>
            <li>Place one strip of nori at the very bottom of the can and plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Put a piece of spam at the bottom, on top of the nori</li>
            <li>Then put however much rice you want on top</li>
            <li>Press down, but too hard. You want the spam and rice to not fall out once you are snacking on it</li>
            <li>After the rice has been placed, fold the Nori on top of the rice</li>
            <li>Then grab the plastic wrap sides and pull everything out</li>
            <li>Wrap the plastic wraps around the musubi and then you are done!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Musubi should look like: </p>
